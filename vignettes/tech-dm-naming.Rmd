This vignette describes the logic behind the names of the {dm}-functions.

In general, the functions are implemented in such a way that no function can handle instances of both `dm` classes (`dm` and `dm_zoomed`) as an argument.
In most situations, a `dm_zoomed` behaves like a table and there are mostly no explicit functions available for this class, but rather methods (see vignette ["Zooming and manipulating tables"](https://cynkra.github.io/dm/articles/tech-dm-zoom.html).

## Prefixes

1. `dm_`: There are two cases for this prefix:
    - The function takes a `dm` object as a first argument
    - The function constructs a `dm` object from other objects
1. `check_`: Certain tests on the arguments are performed and an error is thrown in case they are not passed. If the tests are passed, the first argument is returned invisibly.
1. `examine_`: The function executes checks and returns an object containing an overview of the results of the checks.

Most important extended prefixes `dm_..._`:

1. `dm_examine_`: The function examines several aspects of a `dm` object
1. `dm_add_`: Adds either key constraints or new tables to a `dm`
1. `dm_get_`: Retrieves a specific piece of information about the `dm` (often a part of its constituents)
1. `dm_rm_`: Removes either key constraints or tables from a `dm`

## Suffixes

1. `_dm`: Validators, checkers, or coercers
1. `_to_tbl`: Data from a `dm` is processed in a way that a tibble is produced
1. `_candidates`: If key-candidates are to be calculated and presented in tibble-form
1. `_pk(s)`: Relates to primary key(s)
1. `_fk(s)`: Relates to foreign key(s)
1. `_tbl`: Add/remove/select/rename a tibble to/from/within a `dm` object
1. `_colors`: Relates to the colors for the visualization of a `dm` object
1. `_zoomed`: Insert, update, or discard the zoomed table. In combination with the prefix `dm_`, this indicates that the first argument is a `dm_zoomed` rather than a `dm`.
