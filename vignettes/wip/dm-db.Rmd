## Connecting to a database

- Example: [financial dataset](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/Financial), borrow text from blog post
- `dm_from_src()`

``````{r }
library(RMariaDB)
my_db <- dbConnect(
  MariaDB(),
  user = 'guest',
  password = 'relational',
  dbname = 'Financial_ijs',
  host = 'relational.fit.cvut.cz'
)
my_dm <- dm_from_src(my_db)

my_dm
``````

- Flexible creation from individual tables or views

``````{r }
dbListTables(my_db)

library(dbplyr)
loans <- tbl(my_db, "loans")
accounts <- tbl(my_db, "accounts")

my_manual_dm <- dm(loans, accounts)
my_manual_dm
``````

- Primary and foreign key constraints on the database interpreted currently only for Postgres and SQL Server databases, need to define manually for other databases
    - Borrow from blog post

``````{r }
my_dm_keys <-
  my_manual_dm %>%
  dm_add_pk(accounts, id) %>%
  dm_add_pk(loans, id) %>%
  dm_add_fk(loans, account_id, accounts) %>%
  dm_set_colors(green = loans)

my_dm_keys %>%
  dm_draw()
``````




- Adding tables to existing objects: `dm_add_tbl()` for same source


``````{r }
trans <- tbl(my_db, "trans")

my_dm_keys %>%
  dm_add_tbl(trans)
``````

- Reminder: all operations are transient unless stored in a new variable

``````{r }
my_dm_keys

my_dm_trans <-
  my_dm_keys %>%
  dm_add_tbl(trans)

my_dm_trans
``````

- Copying tables into existing objects: `copy_to()` demonstrated further below, in "deploying" section

## Transient nature of operations

- Like dbplyr, results are never written to database unless asked explicitly
- Example: flattening operation and its translation to SQL

``````{r }
my_dm_keys %>%
  dm_flatten_to_tbl(loans)

my_dm_keys %>%
  dm_flatten_to_tbl(loans) %>%
  sql_render()
``````

- Example: Zooming, summarizing, putting back

``````{r }
my_dm_total <-
  my_dm_keys %>%
  dm_zoom_to(loans) %>%
  group_by(account_id) %>%
  summarize(total_amount = sum(amount, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  dm_insert_zoomed("total_loans")

my_dm_total$total_loans

my_dm_total %>%
  dm_draw()

my_dm_total$total_loans %>%
  sql_render()
``````


## Persisting results

- Relevant phrase, from `?dbplyr::compute`: "Force computation of a query", needs to be adapted to our needs (=multiple queries)
- Requires write access to the database (at least for temporary tables), which we don't have on relational.fit
    - Workaround for demonstration only: copy to local SQLite database, see below for details on `copy_dm_to()`


``````{r }
library(RSQLite)
my_sqlite_db <- dbConnect(SQLite(), ":memory:")
my_dm_local <-
  my_dm_keys %>%
  collect()
my_dm_sqlite <- copy_dm_to(my_sqlite_db, my_dm_local)


my_dm_total <-
  my_dm_sqlite %>%
  dm_zoom_to(loans) %>%
  group_by(account_id) %>%
  summarize(total_amount = sum(amount, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  dm_insert_zoomed("total_loans")
``````


- Two dbplyr verbs implemented for dm objects, retaining their meaning
    - `compute()` materializes all tables into new (temporary or persistent) tables

``````{r }
my_dm_total_computed <-
  my_dm_total %>%
  compute()

my_dm_total_computed$total_loans

my_dm_total_computed$total_loans %>%
  sql_render()
``````

    - `collect()` downloads all tables to local data frames (FIXME: feel free to change order of narrative altogether to remove code repetition)

``````{r }
my_dm_local <-
  my_dm_total %>%
  collect()

my_dm_local$total_loans
``````

    - The third verb, `collapse()`, is not yet implemented ([#304](https://github.com/krlmlr/dm/issues/304)).
- `compute()` also works for zoomed dm


``````{r }
my_dm_total_inplace <-
  my_dm_sqlite %>%
  dm_zoom_to(loans) %>%
  group_by(account_id) %>%
  summarize(total_amount = sum(amount, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  compute() %>%
  dm_insert_zoomed("total_loans")

my_dm_total_inplace$total_loans %>%
  sql_render()
``````


## Deploying a dm to a database

- `copy_dm_to()`, see code above
