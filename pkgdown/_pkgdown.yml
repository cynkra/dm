      - text: Introduction to relational data models
        href: articles/howto-dm-theory.html
        desc: |
          Do you know all about data frames but very little about relational data
          models? This quick introduction will walk you through the key similarities
          and differences, and show you how to move from individual data frames
          to a relational data model.
      - text: Create a dm object from data frames
        href: articles/howto-dm-df.html
        desc: |
          Is your data in local data frames? This article covers creating a data
          model from your local data frames, including building the relationships
          in your data model, verifying your model, and leveraging the power of
          dplyr to operate on your data model.
      - text: Create a dm object from a database
        href: articles/howto-dm-db.html
        desc: |
          This article covers accessing and working with RDBMSs within your
          R session, including manipulating data, filling in missing relationships
          between tables, getting data out of the RDBMS and into your model, and
          deploying your data model to an RDBMS.
      - text: Copy data to and from a database
        href: articles/howto-dm-copy.html
        desc: |
          This article covers methods and techniques for copying individual tables
          and entire relational data models into an RDBMS.
      - text: Insert, update, or remove rows in a database
        href: articles/howto-dm-rows.html
        desc: |
          This tutorial introduces the methods {dm} provides for modifying the data
          in the tables of a relational model.

      - text: Visualizing dm objects
        href: articles/tech-dm-draw.html
        desc: |
          A quick guide to dm's methods for drawing your data model for exploration,
          verification, or documentation purposes. Learn how to customize the diagrams.
      - text: Manipulating individual tables
        href: articles/tech-dm-keyed.html
        desc: |
          Learn how to manipulate the data in the tables in your dm
          using dplyr verbs and deconstruction/reconstruction.
      - text: Joining in relational data models
        href: articles/tech-dm-join.html
        desc: |
          Joining is how separate, linked tables are virtually combined in order
          to perform operations, generate summaries, or prepare data for extraction.
          This article covers dm's methods for creating the different kind of joins
          along with usage examples.
      - text: Filtering in relational data models
        href: articles/tech-dm-filter.html
        desc: |
          Need a subset of your data across tables? This introduction to dm's
          filtering methods will show you how to apply them to data that is separated
          into multiple tables.
      - text: Zooming and manipulating tables
        href: articles/tech-dm-zoom.html
        desc: |
          Learn how to manipulate the data in the tables in your dm
          using dplyr verbs and zooming.
      - text: Model verification - keys, constraints and normalization
        href: articles/tech-dm-low-level.html
        desc: |
          If your data model needs to be rock solid, this article covers the dm methods
          for checking every aspect of the model. It covers key constraints, cardinalities
          between tables, and methods for normalization as you construct your data model.
      - text: Class 'dm' and basic operations
        href: articles/tech-dm-class.html
        desc: |
          A detailed overview of the `"dm"` class.
