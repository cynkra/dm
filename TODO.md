# FIXME NEXT

- un-skip tests

# Later

- Store `keys` objects in dm, much easier for debugging
- Add "strict mode" to GitHub Actions: validation in `new_dm3()`
- Named PK and unique constraints: https://github.com/r-dbi/DBI/pull/351#issuecomment-833438890
- `dm_paste()`: remove `select` argument from documentation, via `_impl()` function that takes dots and this argument, like `dm_rm_pk()`
- Persistent test dm objects
  - Use `copy_to(temporary = FALSE)`
  - sqlite and duckdb: use file that can be discarded
  - Requires schema support for all databases
