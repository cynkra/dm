#' Creates a [`dm`] object for the \pkg{nycflights13} data
#'
#' @description Creates an example [`dm`] object from the tables in \pkg{nycflights13},
#' along with the references.
#' See [nycflights13::flights] for a description of the data.
#' As described in [nycflights13::planes], the relationship
#' between the `flights` table and the `planes` tables is "weak", it does not satisfy
#' data integrity constraints.
#'
#' @param cycle Boolean. If `FALSE` (default), only one foreign key relation
#'   (from `flights$origin` to `airports$faa`) between the `flights` table and the `airports` table is
#'   established. If `TRUE`, a `dm` object with a double reference
#'   between those tables will be produced.
#' @param color Boolean, if `TRUE` (default), the resulting `dm` object will have
#'   colors assigned to different tables for visualization with `cdm_draw()`
