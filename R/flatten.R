#' Flatten a part of a `dm` into a wide table
#'
#' `dm_flatten_to_tbl()` and `dm_squash_to_tbl()` gather all information of interest in one place in a wide table.
#' Both functions perform a disambiguation of column names and a cascade of joins.
#'
#' @inheritParams dm_join_to_tbl
#' @param start The table from which all outgoing foreign key relations are considered
#'   when establishing a processing order for the joins.
#'   An interesting choice could be
#'   for example a fact table in a star schema.
#' @param ... Unquoted names of the tables to be included in addition to the `start` table.
#' The order of the tables here determines
#'   the order of the joins.
#'   If the argument is empty, all tables that can be reached will be included.
#'   If this includes tables that are not direct neighbors of `start`,
#'   it will only work with `dm_squash_to_tbl()` (given one of the allowed join-methods).
#'   `tidyselect` is supported, see [`dplyr::select()`] for details on the semantics.
#' @family flattening functions
#'
#' @details With `...` left empty, this function will join together all the tables of your [`dm`]
#' object that can be reached from the `start` table, in the direction of the foreign key relations
#' (pointing from the child tables to the parent tables), using the foreign key relations to
#' determine the argument `by` for the necessary joins.
#' The result is one table with unique column names.
#' Use the `...` argument if you would like to control which tables should be joined to the `start` table.
#'
#' How does filtering affect the result?
#'
#' **Case 1**, either no filter conditions are set in the `dm`, or set only in the part that is unconnected to the `start` table:
#' The necessary disambiguations of the column names are performed first.
#' Then all involved foreign tables are joined to the `start` table successively, with the join function given in the `join` argument.
#'
#' **Case 2**, filter conditions are set for at least one table that is connected to `start`:
#' First, disambiguation will be performed if necessary. The `start` table is then calculated using `tbl(dm, "start")`.
#' This implies
#' that the effect of the filters on this table is taken into account.
#' For `right_join`, `full_join` and `nest_join`, an error
#' is thrown if any filters are set because filters will not affect the right hand side tables and the result will therefore be
#' incorrect in general (calculating the effects on all RHS-tables would also be time-consuming, and is not supported;
#' if desired, call `dm_apply_filters()` first to achieve that effect).
#' For all other join types, filtering only the `start` table is enough because the effect is passed on by
#' successive joins.
#'
#' Mind that calling `dm_flatten_to_tbl()` with `join = right_join` and no table order determined in the `...` argument
#' will not lead to a well-defined result if two or more foreign tables are to be joined to `start`.
#' The resulting
#' table would depend on the order the tables that are listed in the `dm`.
#' Therefore, trying this will result in a warning.
#'
#' Since `join = nest_join()` does not make sense in this direction (LHS = child table, RHS = parent table: for valid key constraints
#' each nested column entry would be a tibble of one row), an error will be thrown if this method is chosen.
#'
#' @return A single table that results from consecutively joining all affected tables to the `start` table.
