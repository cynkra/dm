# Foreign key candidates

**\[experimental\]**

Determine which columns would be good candidates to be used as foreign
keys of a table, to reference the primary key column of another table of
the [`dm`](https://dm.cynkra.com/dev/reference/dm.md) object.

## Usage

``` r
dm_enum_fk_candidates(dm, table, ref_table, ...)

enum_fk_candidates(dm_zoomed, ref_table, ...)
```

## Arguments

- dm:

  A `dm` object.

- table:

  The table whose columns should be tested for suitability as foreign
  keys.

- ref_table:

  A table with a primary key.

- ...:

  These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.

- dm_zoomed:

  A `dm` with a zoomed table.

## Value

A tibble with the following columns:

- `columns`:

  columns of `table`,

- `candidate`:

  boolean: are these columns a candidate for a foreign key,

- `why`:

  if not a candidate for a foreign key, explanation for for this.

## Details

`dm_enum_fk_candidates()` first checks if `ref_table` has a primary key
set, if not, an error is thrown.

If `ref_table` does have a primary key, then a join operation will be
tried using that key as the `by` argument of join() to match it to each
column of `table`. Attempting to join incompatible columns triggers an
error.

The outcome of the join operation determines the value of the `why`
column in the result:

- an empty value for a column of `table` that is a suitable foreign key
  candidate

- the count and percentage of missing matches for a column that is not
  suitable

- the error message triggered for unsuitable candidates that may include
  the types of mismatched columns

`enum_fk_candidates()` works like `dm_enum_fk_candidates()` with the
zoomed table as `table`.

## Life cycle

These functions are marked "experimental" because we are not yet sure
about the interface, in particular if we need both `dm_enum...()` and
`enum...()` variants. Changing the interface later seems harmless
because these functions are most likely used interactively.
