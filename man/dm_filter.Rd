\usage{
dm_filter(.dm, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.dm}{A \code{dm} object.}

\item{...}{Named logical predicates.
The names correspond to tables in the \code{dm} object.
The predicates are defined in terms of the variables in the corresponding table,
they are passed on to \code{\link[dplyr:filter]{dplyr::filter()}}.

Multiple conditions are combined with \code{&}.
Only the rows where the condition evaluates
to \code{TRUE} are kept.}
}
\value{
An updated \code{dm} object with filters executed across all tables.
}

Filtering a table of a \code{\link{dm}} object may affect other tables that are connected to it
directly or indirectly via foreign key relations.

\code{dm_filter()} can be used to define filter conditions for tables using syntax that is similar to \code{\link[dplyr:filter]{dplyr::filter()}}.
The filters work across related tables:
The resulting \code{dm} object only contains rows that are related
(directly or indirectly) to rows that remain after applying the filters
on all tables.
}
\details{
As of dm 1.0.0, these conditions are no longer stored in the \code{dm} object,
instead they are applied to all tables during the call to \code{dm_filter()}.
Calling \code{dm_apply_filters()} or \code{dm_apply_filters_to_tbl()} is no longer necessary.

Use \code{\link[=dm_zoom_to]{dm_zoom_to()}} and \code{\link[dplyr:filter]{dplyr::filter()}} to filter rows without affecting related tables.
