\title{Add tables to a \code{\link{dm}}}
\usage{
cdm_add_tbl(dm, ..., repair = "unique", quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dm}{A \code{\link{dm}} object}

\item{...}{One or more tibbles to add to the \code{dm}.
If no explicit name is given, the name of the expression is used.}

\item{repair}{Either a string or a function. If a string, it must
be one of \code{"check_unique"}, \code{"minimal"}, \code{"unique"}, or \code{"universal"}.
If a function, it is invoked with a vector of minimal names and must
return minimal names, otherwise an error is thrown.
\itemize{
\item Minimal names are never \code{NULL} or \code{NA}. When an element doesn't
have a name, its minimal name is an empty string.
\item Unique names are unique. A suffix is appended to duplicate
names to make them unique.
\item Universal names are unique and syntactic, meaning that you can
safely use the names as variables without causing a syntax
error.
}

The \code{"check_unique"} option doesn't perform any name repair.
Instead, an error is raised if the names don't suit the
\code{"unique"} criteria.}

\item{quiet}{By default, the user is informed of any renaming
caused by repairing the names. This only concerns unique and
universal repairing. Set \code{quiet} to \code{TRUE} to silence the
messages.}
}
\value{
The inital \code{dm} with the additional table(s).
}
