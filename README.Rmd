# dm

The goal of {dm} is to provide tools for working with multiple tables.
Skip to the [Features section](#features) if you are familiar with relational data models.

- [Why?](#why) gives a short motivation
- [Features](#features) gives a one-page overview over the scope of this package
- [Example](#example) outlines some of the features in a short example
- [More information](#more-information) offers links to more detailed articles
- [Standing on the shoulders of giants](#standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants) shows related work
- [Installation](#installation) describes how to install the package


## Why?

As an example, we consider the [nycflights13](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13) dataset.
This dataset contains five tables: the main `flights` table with links into the `airlines`, `planes` and `airports` tables, and a `weather` table without an explicit link.

```{r draw, echo = FALSE}
cdm_nycflights13(cycle = TRUE) %>% 
  cdm_draw()
```

The separation into multiple tables achieves several goals:

- **Avoid repetition, conserve memory**: the facts about each airline, airport, and airplane are stored only once
    - name of each airline
    - name, location and altitude of each airport
    - manufacturer and number of seats for each airplane
- **Improve consistency**: if facts (e.g. the name of an airport) need to be updated, they need to be updated in only one place
- **Segmentation**: facts are organized by topic, individual tables are smaller and easier to handle

The links are established through *primary* and *foreign keys*: a primary key identifies rows/tuples/observations of *this* table, foreign keys link to a row/tuple/observation in *another* table.
See the [Simple English Wikipedia article on database normalization](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalisation) for more detail.

### Joining

The separation into multiple tables helps data quality but poses a different challenge:
for each flight, the location of the origin airport, or the details on the airplane, are not available immediately but must be *joined*/merged:

```{r join}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

flights %>% 
  select(month, day, origin, tailnum) %>% 
  left_join(airports, by = c("origin" = "faa")) %>% 
  left_join(planes, by = "tailnum")
```

## Features

This package helps with many challenges that arise when working with relational data models.

### Compound object

The `dm` class manages several related tables.
It stores both the **data** and the **metadata** in a compound object, and defines operations on that object.
These operations either affect the data (e.g., a filter), or the metadata (e.g., definition of keys or creation of a new table), or both.

- data: a table source storing all tables
- metadata: table names, column names, primary and foreign keys

This concept helps separating the join logic from the code: declare your relationships once, as part of your data, then use them in your code without repeating yourself.


### Storage agnostic

The {dm} package augments [{dplyr}](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)/[{dbplyr}](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) workflows.
Generally, if you can use {dplyr} on your data, it's likely that you can use {dm} too.
This includes local data frames, relational database systems, and many more.


### Data preparation

A battery of utilities helps with creating a tidy relational data model.

- Splitting and rejoining tables
- Determining key candidates
- Checking keys and cardinalities


## Example

A readymade `dm` object with preset keys is included in the package:

```{r dm}
library(dm)

cdm_nycflights13()
```

The `cdm_draw()` function creates a visualization of the entity relationship model:

```{r draw, echo = TRUE}
```

### Filtering and joining {#filter}

Similarly to `dplyr::filter()`, a filtering function `cdm_filter()` is available for `dm` objects.
You need to provide the `dm` object, the table whose rows you want to filter, and the filter expression.
A `dm` object is returned whose tables only contain rows that are related to the reduced rows in the filtered table.
This currently only works for cycle-free relationships between the tables.

```{r}
cdm_nycflights13(cycle = FALSE) %>%
  cdm_get_tables() %>%
  map_int(nrow)

cdm_nycflights13(cycle = FALSE) %>% 
  cdm_filter(planes, year == 2000, manufacturer == "BOEING") %>%
  cdm_get_tables() %>%
  map_int(nrow)
```

For joining two tables using their relationship defined in the `dm`, you can use `cdm_join_tbl()`:

```{r}
cdm_nycflights13(cycle = FALSE) %>%
  cdm_join_tbl(airports, flights, join = semi_join)
```

In our `dm`, the `origin` column of the `flights` table points to the `airports` table.
Since all `nycflights13`-flights depart from New York, only these airports are included in the semi-join.

### From and to databases

In order to transfer an existing `dm` object to a DB, you can call `cdm_copy_to()` with the target DB and the `dm` object:

```{r}
src_sqlite <- src_sqlite(":memory:", create = TRUE)
src_sqlite
nycflights13_remote <- cdm_copy_to(src_sqlite, cdm_nycflights13(cycle = TRUE))
nycflights13_remote
```

The key constraints from the original object are also copied to the newly created object.
With the default setting `set_key_constraints = TRUE` for `cdm_copy_to()`, key constraints are also established on the target DB.
Currently this feature is only supported for MSSQL and Postgres database management systems (DBMS).

It is also possible to automatically create a `dm` object from the permanent tables of a DB.
Again, for now just MSSQL and Postgres are supported for this feature, so the next chunk is not evaluated.
The support for other DBMS will be implemented in a future update.

```{r eval=FALSE}
src_postgres <- src_postgres()
nycflights13_from_remote <- cdm_learn_from_db(src_postgres)
```

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

This package follows the tidyverse principles:

- `dm` objects are immutable (your data will never be overwritten in place)
- many functions used on `dm` objects are pipeable (i.e., return new `dm` objects)
- tidy evaluation is used (unquoted function parameters are supported)

The {dm} package builds heavily upon the [{datamodelr} package](https://github.com/bergant/datamodelr), and upon the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
We're looking forward to a good collaboration!

The [{polyply} package](https://github.com/russHyde/polyply) has a similar intent with a slightly different interface.

Articles in the [{rquery} package](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery) discuss [join controllers](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/blob/master/extras/JoinController.md) and [join dependency sorting](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/blob/master/extras/DependencySorting.md), with the intent to move the declaration of table relationships from code to data.

The [{tidygraph} package](https://github.com/thomasp85/tidygraph) stores a network as two related tables of `nodes` and `edges`, compatible with {dplyr} workflows.

In object-oriented programming languages, [object-relational mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) is a similar concept that attempts to map a set of related tables to a class hierarchy.
