# NB. The following changes were made to the snapshotted files:
#
# 1. Calls to `rlang::quo()` have been suppressed, since these calls capture
#    an ephemeral environment that cannot be reproduced across separate test
#    runs.
#
# 2. `cg_block` invocations are excluded, since they belong to a separate and
#    independent testing unit.
